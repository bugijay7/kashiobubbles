          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed">
            Kashio Bubbles began as a humble dream by <span className="font-semibold text-white">Faith Loice</span>, a passionate and determined entrepreneur from Kiamba.
            What started with a single washing machine in a small room has blossomed into a trusted local laundromat known for reliability, care, and a personal touch.
            <br /><br />
            Faith's vision was simple: to help busy families and professionals enjoy clean clothes without the hassle.
            With hard work and a heart for service, Kashio Bubbles has grown to become a favorite in the community,
            offering quality laundry services at fair prices.
            <br /><br />
            Today, we continue to serve <span className="text-white font-medium">Kiamba, Sigona, Zambezi</span> and the environs with pride â€” staying true to our roots while embracing innovation to serve you better every day.
